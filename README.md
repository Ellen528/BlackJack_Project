# BlackJack_Project
## How to Use the Program
### Introduction
This project uses Python's Streamlit package to create a web app for playing Blackjack. The web app offers an intuitive interface, making the game easily accessible and enjoyable.

### Web App Pages
The web app consists of two main pages: "Home" and "PlayGround with Statistics."
1. Home Page
•	Introduction & How to Play: Provides basic information about Blackjack for newcomers.
•	Strategy Cheatsheet: Offers a simple strategy reference to improve winning chances.
•	Gameplay: Allows users to play Blackjack directly on the page with two modes:
  - Autoplay: Automatically follows basic rules for hitting or stopping.
  - Manual Play: Users decide whether to hit or stop.
•	Users can play any number of rounds for entertainment.
2. PlayGround with Statistics Page
•	Displays statistical insights from the game, including player and dealer win rates.
•	Users select the number of rounds to play and view their performance through graphical representations.
•	A message indicates how the user's “Luck” compares to the distribution of all other possibilities.

### Future Developments
•	Modularizing the Code: Splitting the main app script into smaller, manageable files to improve code organization and maintainability.
•	Implementing full Blackjack rules, including split and double functionalities.
•	Enhancing the autoplay mode with a comprehensive strategy.
•	Exploring additional strategies, such as card counting, to analyze their impact on winning rates through extensive statistical analysis.
